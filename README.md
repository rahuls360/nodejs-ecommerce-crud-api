## Create a CRUD Api for an E-Commerce Dog Store

Created a nodejs API that is used to store dogs sold on an E-Commerce store

## CRUD

GET /products -> Get all dogs
GET /products/product_id -> Get particular dog details
POST /products -> Create a new dog
PATCH /products/product_id -> Update a particular dog
DELETE /products/product_id -> Delete a particular dog

## Features
